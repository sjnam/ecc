# Elliptic Curve Cryptography

This is an elliptic curve cryptography package that I'm putting together for my own education.

- Elliptic Curve
- ECDLP
  - Shank
  - Pollard's rho
  - Pohlig Hellman
- ECDSA
- Schoof Algorithm
  - Counting points on elliptic curves over finite fields
  - TOO SLOW !!!
